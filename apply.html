                    <h2>What we teach</h2>
                    <p>The Techsmiths programme is designed by industry-leading engineers, to teach all of the skills you need to contribute to a wide range of projects.  Software development is the main focus, and we’ll teach you how to work with some of the most popular languages at the moment – but it doesn’t stop there.  You’ll learn how to plan and design solutions, manage projects, test things effectively.  Techsmiths also get experience deploying, monitoring and upgrading software – a vital part of turning your great ideas into software that improves the world.</p>

                    <h2>How we teach it</h2>
                    <p>Our 12 week bootcamp gives you the opportunity to work on a number of short projects and training exercises, increasing in scale and complexity over the course of the programme.  We have very low student:coach ratios, which means you’ll get lots of 1:1 attention from an expert software developer.  We like to work in small groups, collaboratively solving difficult problems and having lots of fun on the way!</p>
