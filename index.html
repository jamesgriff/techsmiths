                    <h2>Break into tech</h2>
                    <p>We don't think you need to have been coding for years or studied computer science to be a great software developer! If you love to learn and problem solve then you could be a great developer too!</p>
                    <p>The skills and experience you have gained in previous roles allow you to bring something extra to the table and give you  more dimension as a developer than someone who went though a more "traditional" route into coding.</p>
